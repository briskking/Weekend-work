          <li>According to his mum who flew him to europe through the help of a friend to play football, she said he could comfortably be both a good lawyer and footballer at same time but he felt football was the better path</li>
          <li>1984- Upon getting to Europe, he was first spotted by scouts from Associazione Sportiva Roma(As Roma) Italy</li>

          <li>  Insisted on Playing for Nigeria when his club SSV-ULM 1846 and the NFA(Nigeria Football Association) had a misuderstanding over his availability for national team game. ‘I am a lawyer and you know and I signed to play football for certain conditions but I don’t think it included reselling my services to my country. he said. "I am going to represent my country whether you like it or not."
          <li> His mum in an interview after his death said, "He was very keen, very serious, very anxious to play for his country. he wasn’t the only one invited atimes, others were invited but didn’t go because they said Nigeria was not giving them anything, any money but Sam uses his little money to come down to Nigeria, they don’t send them tickets…." </li>
